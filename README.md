OVERVIEW
This is a virtual reality app that mirrors the world. Being a VR app, its perception of the real world is in 3D. “Maxi-lander” presents a full and immersive experience of the real world to its users while allowing them interact with the objects they encounter in the virtual world. 

USE CASES
The usefulness of this app is boundless as even the full potentials of VR itself is yet to be fully explored. However, these advantages include the following;
1.	A 3D learning experience: studies have shown that the human brain learns faster with improved visual learning aids. Also, as we look into a future that obviously will be run by increased intelligence, there is need for a smart population. Therefore, there is need for a new and improved learning experience. To foster human intelligence through learning, “Maxi-lander” provides the best form of learning experience which is delivered in 3D. To this end, the app modelled a T-Rex, this was done with hopes to present a feeling of immersion to the body parts and structures of the creature in order to demonstrate how an immersive interaction with it will enable people (especially children) appreciate nature and what they learn. 
2.	Virtual project walk-through: interior decoration and architectural firms can use this technology to provide the best immersive customer service. This is because every building plan done with a CAD software has a 3D model. That model can be used in this VR app. Similarly, furniture can be instantiated as prefabs at any time and place. This makes it possible to map any house or items in the app depending on the demand of the business and its customers. This opens a whole new industry, one that VR app maintenance and updating contract will be handed to companies that create VR apps.
In addition, it also provides a means of entertainment and fun activity while improving both the way people understand things and do business. 

HOW TO USE
There are several capabilities of this product. The user can interact with the objects in the scene after they have been created. The position, size and rotation of the objects can be changed. There is the option of teleportation and walking. Selection is done using a reticle. This reticle turns blue when if falls on an object or button that it has the capacity to interact with (which is any button or part of the house with a specific function). These capabilities are used as enumerated below.

Locomotion 
•	Walk: the user selects the walk option in the 3D menu and looks to anywhere in the room and with the push of a button they are translated gradually to that location. 
•	Teleport: the user clicks on the teleport button. This triggers the “floor.cs” file and so makes the floor “gaze able”. The user looks on the floor (only the floor) in the room where they intend to teleport to; with the push of the button, they appear there.

Object Instantiation
There are three objects that can be placed in this scene. This list however can go on and on but for our purposes, we have just the lamp, chair and table. To instantiate them in the scene, at the 3D menu, at the furniture section, select and click on the button containing the item (object) you want to create then look on the floor (the location in the room where you want to keep them), immediately it will be instantiated there.

Object Interaction
The 3D menu in the scene contains the transform section. It has three buttons stating the three transform capabilities. To use any, click on the desired transform, look on the instantiated object and drag it around with your button still pressed down around the scene. This step is true for all transform cases.
a.	Select the desired transform
b.	Gaze on the object and press down your button
c.	With your eyes still on it and button pressed down,
•	By moving your head in any direction, change the position of the object
•	By looking up or down, rotate or scale the object.
In conclusion, you can drag the menu around using the drag button at the bottom of the menu.
